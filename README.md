# Course Overviews for BSc Applied Earth Sciences

This repository contains several course overviews that I created during my undergraduate studies at the Delft University of Technology.

Note that these are rarely exhaustive compilations of the course material.
Instead, they contain the content that I found the most important at the time of following the course.
I created these notes so that I'd have the information that I needed in a format that made sense to me.

These have been very useful in open-note exams.
