# Course Overviews for BSc Applied Earth Sciences

This repository contains several course overviews that I created during my undergraduate studies at the Delft University of Technology.

Note that these are rarely exhaustive compilations of the material covered in the course.
Instead, they contain the content that I considered to be the most important while following the course.
I created these notes so that I'd have the information that I needed in a format that made sense to me.

These have been very useful in open-note exams.
